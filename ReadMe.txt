Synopsis report: Secure E-card System to Reduce Physical Card Usage.
 
 


1.	Abstract:  
A software based on cyber technology which is used to gather credentials from the client using our application based on multi -factor authentication and encryption techniques and then store the information in our secured database hence preventing data breaches and reduce the physical card usage.
It reduces the risk of getting compromised in the banking sector. Also, improving overall efficiency of the banking system (ATM Machines), and hence, bringing an ease in real world scenario.



















2.	Introduction: 
The primary goal of this software is to collect card credentials from clients and then store the information in our secure database using salting and our proprietary encryption techniques. 
This software will reduce the need of having card physically to be present with us, instead of having the card with us, the user will be directly able to perform any ATM related operations simply with username and password. 
Firstly, we are using basic HTML, CSS, JS (Technologies used). Then we will take username and passwords of Users and will store all the credentials in our secured database and by using Encryption and hashing algorithm’s the information will be secured and will be available whenever required by the user. Also, multi-factor authentication will be used to make a secure login authentication process.






















3.	Problem Statement: 
Human carelessness is one of the most prominent reasons for data breaches in cyber-attacks, many people misplace their critical cards and if the lost card comes in wrong hands, then a lot of trouble can occur. 59% of internet users include their name and/or date of birth in their passwords and most users don’t use strong passwords and their credentials can easily be compromised hence not making a secure system. Hashing and Encryption can solve many security issues of the same and if the physical need of cards is reduced then this problem of human carelessness can be resolved, and an efficient transaction system can be created. And also, the difficulty of managing multiple cards physically can be avoided.



































4.	Literature Review:

The origin of ATMs : At a Barclays bank location in Enfield, London, the first ATM was installed in June 1967. Its creation is attributed to a British inventor by the name of John Shepherd-Barron. Customers could withdraw up to £10 from the machine at once. 
The amount of ATM frauds committed using sophisticated software or technologies, like skimming devices, increased in the first ten years of the twenty-first century. Banks created software that could spot irregularities in transactional data that would point to unlawful conduct in order to keep one step ahead of the game.
Cash is still favoured for transactions in the majority of the world, despite the fact that digital payment methods are becoming more and more popular in the twenty-first century. It is anticipated that ATMs, bank branches, mobile banking, and internet banking will all work better together in the near future.

Strong and Weak Passwords: According to Verizon 2020 data breach investigation report [8], weak or stolen passwords were used in 81% of all incidents. Every year, over a million passwords are stolen. Key loggers, social engineering, brute force, dictionary attacks, rainbow attacks, credential stuffing attacks, and other techniques are used to steal passwords. The following statistics were discovered by dataprot.com in another survey:

1.	59% of Americans use a password that contains their name or date of birth.
2.	53% of internet users store passwords in their memories.
3.	57% of victims of phishing scams didn't update their passwords after the incident.

Another reason for compromise of passwords is data breaches of various web and other internet-based applications. If an application gets hacked, all usernames and passwords stored of various users, can be compromised. Modern applications prevent this by using hashing.
Hashing: It transforms the password into an unchangeable string using a variety of methods. No two passwords will ever produce the same hash, yet the same password always does. User passwords are often kept as hashes in most current programmes. When a user registers, their username and password are hashed and kept. When a user logs in, the password is hashed once more, and the database's hash is compared to the hash of the password the user submitted. Authentication is successful if the hashes of the two files match.
Although it may appear to be a full proof system, weak passwords can still be accessed in the event of a data breach. It is still possible to determine the original password by comparing the hashes to those of passwords that are known, even though a hash cannot be converted back into the original password. For instance, some of the most popular passwords on the internet are found in the infamous rockyou.txt wordlist. Each password in a wordlist can be hashed by a hacker, who can then compare it to the user's leaked hash. The user's password is the one that corresponds to the hash in rockyou.txt if two hashes match. Running simple programmes like hash cat or john the ripper makes it possible for script kids to perform this task as well.

5.	Objectives: 
•	The main objective of this software is to reduce the physical use of cards(debit/credit) and do the ATM transactions by using simple username and passwords so that problem of human carelessness (stolen card or lost card) can be resolved.
•	The application will be able to get card credentials from the clients and then store the data in our secured database using salting and encryption techniques.
•	No weak passwords will be used i.e., conditions on password making will be there so that user can only be able to create strong passwords hence enhancing the security and reducing the risk of password cracking.
•	The data or the credentials will be stored securely in our database by using strong encryption algorithms so that information/ credentials of the users will remain secure if by any chance a data breach occurs.
•	Multi-factor authentication will be provided for a secure login so that no fraud login’s can occur and hence transaction can be done by authentic user only.
